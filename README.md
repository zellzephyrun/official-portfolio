<h1>MY PORTFOLIO</h1>

Hi.

I commit my personal projects here. 

Aside from weekly activities, my college teachers encouraged us with challenges, YouTube videos, documentaries and puzzles so we could work on our own things. But I didn't knew those things could be part of a portfolio. I thought:

"Why would a recruiter care about them?"

Turns out it's all about skill evaluation, good practices and Clean Code.

So I'll restore them from my Drive (they were in my old PC, and now I have a high-end one babyyyyyy), review and submit, adding comments to explain what I was doing and tidying and wrapping up things.

<s> Please be gentle I'm just a student who think codes are fun I never worked anywhere please hire me :peepo: </s>
