<h1> POKÉMON NON-OFFICIAL POKÉDEX</h1>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

This is a small project I did using HTML, JS and CSS, using the REST PokéAPI to get the IDs, names and GIFs of the Pokémon stored within their database.

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the API, I couldn't make it reproduce the GIFs from more recent Pokémons, only their IDs and names. I'll try to fix that another time.

Clone or download the .zip, then extract and execute the index.html file to open the Pokédex on your browser.

Comments will tell you what each step does.
